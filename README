  Using Duh Draw

      Maximum Columns - 80 (Fixed)
      Maximum Lines - 1000
 
      Home - Beginning of Line/ANSI.
      End  - End of Line/ANSI.
      Page Up - Up 23 lines.
      Page Down - Down 23 lines.

      Delete - Delete character under cursor.

      Insert - Toggle insert mode.
      When insert mode is active 'In' appears in the status line.

      F1 thru F10 - character in currently selected high ascii set.
      Shift F1 thru Shift F10 - Select highascii set 1 thru 10.

      High ascii sets 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 are accessed by pressing Alt->
      or Alt-<.

      Alt-A toggles attribute drawing mode.
      When in attribute drawing mode 'Attr' will appear in the status
      line. In this mode moving the cursor causes the character
      newly under the cursor to acquire the current foreground
      and background colors.
 
      Alt-B does the block mode thing ALA XxxXxxx.
      Block mode does not highlight the selected block area yet. It will.
      You can now copy blocks.
      Block mode mirror and invert work correctly and
      mirror (or invert) highascii characters.
      Translate will change all instances of one color to another
      while preserving bright/normal intensity.
      Selecting fill mode will bring up a sub menu to fill
      using the current foreground color,background color,both foreground
      and background color or any character you type.
      You may use one of the highascii characters in the selected set
      or press Alt-C to use  the last character picked up with Alt-P.

      Alt-C draws using the last character picked up with Alt-P in the
      current foreground/background color.

      Alt-D toggles line drawing mode.
      Line drawing uses whatever high ascii set you have selected.
      Using high ascii sets above set 4 produces odd results.
      Line drawing mode is not up to snuff yet but will be.
    
      Alt-E prompts if you wish to erase the current page.
      (Currently there is only one page).
   
      Alt-F brings up the color bar where you select fore and back
      colors. Cursor keys to select. Enter to accept.
      
      Alt-H  Help screen.
      Alt-I  Insert Line.
      Alt-J  Insert Column.
      Alt-K  Kill (Delete) Column.  
      Alt-L  Load file.
      Alt-P  Pickup character under cursor.
      Alt-S  Save file.
